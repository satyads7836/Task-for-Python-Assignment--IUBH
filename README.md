Python-Programming-assignment

Welcome to my Python project! Hereâ€™s what my program can do:

Data Loading: My program is capable of loading four training datasets, a test dataset, and datasets for 50 ideal functions. All data consists of x-y pairs of values.

Ideal Function Selection: It uses the training data to select the four ideal functions from the fifty provided that best fit the data. The selection criterion is the minimization of the sum of all y-deviations squared (Least-Square).

Test Data Mapping: It can use the test data to determine if each x-y pair can be assigned to one of the four chosen ideal functions. If so, it executes the mapping and saves it along with the deviation.

Data Visualization: my program is capable of logically visualizing all data.

SQLite Database Compilation: my program can independently compile a SQLite database file via sqlalchemy and load the training data into a single five-column spreadsheet/table in the file.

Object-Oriented Design: The program is sensibly object-oriented and includes at least one inheritance. It also includes standard and user-defined exception handlings.

Documentation: My code is fully documented, including Documentation Strings, known as "docstrings".
